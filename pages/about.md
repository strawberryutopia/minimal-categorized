If you’re interested in specifics, we’re probably [OSDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Other_specified_dissociative_disorder), but who even knows. We’re not particularly interested in pursuing a diagnosis at the moment.

Why do we exist? Again, who knows. Possibly traumagenic, but we don’t really care why we exist, just that we do. Probably mixed origin tbh.

We’re inclusive of all who identify as plural in good faith.

If you have no idea what all that means, [MoreThanOne.info](https://morethanone.info/) is a good overview.

For individual system members, see links on [the home page](/), or in the menu.
